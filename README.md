SquareCue
=========
by Adam Fanello

Background
----------

I was making cue sheets in a word processor. Each song had a document.
In each document was a whole cue sheet for each level of dance I'd made choreography for.
I liked to highlight the actual cues. Then I wanted to add little beat markers to help me keep time.
Adding these meant editing every document, every level, nearly every line - and fighting the word processor
that always handled the font transitions exactly opposite of what I wanted...

    Argh!!!  

That's it. I switched to markup. I developed SquareCue so that I could eliminate duplication, stop fighting
with a word processor, and change my styles once and have _everything_ update automatically!
